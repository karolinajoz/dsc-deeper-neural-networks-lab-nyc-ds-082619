    "In this lesson, we'll dig deeper into the work horse of deep learning, **_Multi-Layer Perceptrons_**! We'll build and train a couple different MLPs with Keras and explore the tradeoffs that come with adding extra hidden layers. We'll also try switching out some of the activation functions we learned about in the previous lesson to see how they affect training and performance. \n",
